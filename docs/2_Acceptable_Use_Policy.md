## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) is to outline the standards for acceptable use of uFilms's computing and network resources. This policy aims to protect the organization, its employees, partners, and clients from illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, temporaries, freelancers and other workers at uFilms, including all personnel affiliated with third parties utilizing our network and computing resources.

## 3. Policy

### 3.1. General Use and Ownership

- Users should be aware that the data they create on the company systems remains the property of uFilms. Because of the need to protect uFilms's network, management cannot guarantee the confidentiality of information stored on any network device belonging to uFilms.

### 3.2. Security and Proprietary Information

- System passwords and accounts are to be kept confidential and not shared or displayed.
- All computing devices must be secured with a password-protected screensaver with an automatic activation feature set at a maximum of 30 minutes or manually locked by the user when the device is unattended.

### 3.3. Unacceptable Use

The following activities are, in general, prohibited. Users may be exempted from these restrictions during the course of their legitimate job responsibilities (e.g., system admin staff may have a need to disable the network access of a host if that host is disrupting production services).

Under no circumstances is an employee of uFilms authorized to engage in any activity that is illegal under local, state, federal, or international law while utilizing uFilms-owned resources.

The lists below are by no means exhaustive, but attempt to provide a framework for activities which fall into the category of unacceptable use.

**Prohibited Activities:**

- Introducing malicious software into the network.
- Revealing your account password to others or allowing the use of your account by others.
- Using a computing asset to actively engage in procuring or transmitting material that is in violation of sexual harassment or hostile workplace laws.

### 3.4. Enforcement

Any employee found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

## 4. Acknowledgement

All employees, contractors, and third-party users of uFilms's information systems are required to acknowledge receipt and confirm that they have understood and agree to abide by the rules hereof.
